\cite{Kasdin25} show that dopamine in the brains of young zebra finches acts as 
a learning signal, increasing when they sing closer to their adult song and 
decreasing when they sing further away, effectively guiding their vocal 
development through trial-and-error. This suggests that complex natural 
behaviors, like learning to sing, are shaped by dopamine-driven reinforcement 
learning, similar to how artificial intelligence learns. You can find the 
paper at this link:
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08729-1}{{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08729-1}.}.

Note they measure dopamine using fibre photometry, changes in the fluorescence
indicate dopamine changes in realtime. Their specific measurement considers 
changes in flourescence in 100-ms windows between 200 and 300 ms from the start 
of singing, averaged across development.

% CONDUCT A POWER ANALYSIS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item Using the \texttt{pwr} package for \texttt{R} \citep{pwr},
conduct a power analysis. How many observations would the researchers 
need to detect a moderate-to-large effect ($d=0.65$) when using 
$\alpha=0.05$ and default power (0.80) for a two-sided one sample 
$t$ test. - \textbf{The researchers would need approximately 21 observations in order to detect a moderate-to-large effect while using the parameters listed above.}

% COLLECT DATA
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Click the link to go to the paper. Find the source data for 
Figure 2. Download the Excel file. Describe what you needed to
do to collect the data for Figure 2(g). Note that you only need the 
\texttt{closer\_vals} and \texttt{further\_vals}. Ensure to 
\texttt{mutate()} the data to get a difference 
(e.g., \texttt{closer\_vals - further\_vals}). - \textbf{In order to collect the data from the paper, I first had to download the xlsx file from the source data provided within the paper, and then copy it into a blank csv file so that it could be read by R.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item Summarize the data.

   dopamine in the brains of young zebra finches decreases when
   they sing further away? - \textbf{The data suggests that the dopamine in the brains of young zebra finches does decrease when the song they sing is further from their addult song as all of the observations display a negative change in flourescence for birds who were further from their adult songs.}

% CONDUCT THE TESTS

\item Conduct the inferences they do in the paper. Make sure to report the results
a little more comprehensively -- that is your parenthetical should look something
like: ($t=23.99$, $p<0.0001$; $g=1.34$; 95\% CI: 4.43, 4.60).\\
\textbf{Note:} Your numbers may vary slightly as they performed some unclear
correction of their $p$-values. I'm waiting to hear back from them via email!
\begin{enumerate}
  \item ``The close responses differed significantly from 0 ($p=1.63 \times 10^{-8}$).'' - The close finch responses differed significantly from 0 and suggest a large effect size ($t=7.9945$, $p=4.34 \times  10^{-8}$; $g=1.34$; 95\% CI: 0.97, 2.17)
  \item ``The far responses differed significantly from 0 ($p=5.17 \times 10^{-8}$).''  - The further finch responses differed significantly from 0 and suggest a large effect size ($t=-7.4785$, $p=1.34 \times  10^{-7}$; $g=-1.48$; 95\% CI: -2.04, -0.89)
  \item ``The difference between populations was significant ($p=1.04 \times10^{-8}$).'' - The difference between closer and further finch responses differed significantly from one another and suggest a large effect size ($t=8.1073$, $p=3.41 \times  10^{-8}$; $g=1.6$; 95\% CI: 0.99, 2.19).
